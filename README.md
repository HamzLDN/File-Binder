# File-Binder
Uses python and C to merge different executables.

Make sure to have both python and C for this to work.

You can only bind exe's but i will also add a new update to make it so you can add other file formats.


Drag and drop different files to combine.py you must drag 2 or more then it will build the exe. For example `combine.py file1.exe file2.exe`
